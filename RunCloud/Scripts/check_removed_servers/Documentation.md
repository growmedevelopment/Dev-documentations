This script automatically detects **servers that still exist in Vultr but no longer exist in RunCloud**, helping you identify orphaned servers you might still be paying for. It:

âœ… Fetches active servers from **Vultr** and **RunCloud**  
âœ… Validates the API responses for correct JSON  
âœ… Compares IPs to find servers present in Vultr but missing in RunCloud  
âœ… Generates a detailed **HTML report** listing these servers  
âœ… Emails the report to your configured recipient

### ðŸ“¥ Inputs

- **Environment variables**:
    - `VULTR_API_TOKEN` â€” Vultr API token
    - `RUNCLOUD_API_TOKEN` â€” RunCloud API token
    - `NOTIFY_EMAIL` â€” recipient email for the report

### ðŸ“¤ Outputs

- HTML report saved at `/tmp/servers_removed_report.html`
- Report emailed to `$NOTIFY_EMAIL`

> **Why use it?**  
> Keep your infrastructure clean and costs under control by identifying servers running in Vultr that are no longer managed in RunCloud.
